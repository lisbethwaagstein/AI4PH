A tendency of teeth to fracture as manifested by a history of repeated fracture of the dental enamel without adequate trauma.
A tendency to ask questions that are overly personal or otherwise inappropriate in the social situation in which they are asked.
A tendency to fall or the inability to keep oneself from falling; imbalance. The retropulsion test is widely regarded as the gold standard to evaluate postural instability, Use of the retropulsion test includes a rapid balance perturbation in the backward direction, and the number of balance correcting steps (or total absence thereof) is used to rate the degree of postural instability. Healthy subjects correct such perturbations with either one or two large steps, or without taking any steps, hinging rapidly at the hips while swinging the arms forward as a counterweight. In patients with balance impairment, balance correcting steps are often too small, forcing patients to take more than two steps. Taking three or more steps is generally considered to be abnormal, and taking more than five steps is regarded as being clearly abnormal. Markedly affected patients continue to step backward without ever regaining their balance and must be caught by the examiner (this would be called true retropulsion). Even more severely affected patients fail to correct entirely, and fall backward like a pushed toy soldier, without taking any corrective steps.,

A tram-track sign is composed of two enhancing areas of tumor separated from each other by the negative defect of the optic nerve. It is seen on contrast-enhanced CT scan and MRI images, in optic nerve sheath meningioma. The sign helps distinguish between optic nerve sheath meningioma and optic glioma. Optic glioma arises from glial cells within the optic nerve and there is no clear separation between the nerve and the tumor; hence the tram-track sign is not seen in optic gliomas. Calcification may be seen in optic nerve sheath meningiomas in 20-50% of cases and hence the tram-track sign may be seen on nonenhanced CT scan images as a linear calcification around the nerve, but this is less common.,

Absence or abnormal closure of the choana (the posterior nasal aperture). Most embryologists believe that posterior choanal atresia results from a failure of rupture between the 35th and 38th day of fetal life of the partition which separates the bucconasal or buccopharyngeal membranes. The resultant choanal atresia may be unilateral or bilateral, bony or membranous, complete or incomplete. In over 90 per cent of cases the obstruction is bony, while in the remainder it is membranous. The bony type of atresia is commonly located 1-2 mm. anterior to the posterior edge of the hard palate, and the osseous septum varies in thickness from 1 to 10 mm. In the membranous form of choanal atresia the obstruction usually occurs further posteriorly. In approximately one third of cases the atresia is bilateral.,

Accumulation of granular osmiophilic material in blood vessel walls. Osmiophilic material becomes black upon staining with osmium tetroxide. Deposition of granular osmiophilic material (GOM) is the vascular pathological hallmark of CADASIL, which is the most prevalent hereditary small vessel disease and is caused by missense mutations in the NOTCH3 gene. GOM have been shown to contain NOTCH3 ectodomain (NOTCH3ECD) and extracellular matrix proteins, and can be visualized ultrastructurally in the tunica media of small arteries and capillaries. These electron dense GOM deposits are located in the basement membrane of mural cells, i.e. vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes. In both manifest and pre-manifest CADASIL patients, GOM deposits are present not only in brain vessels, but also in vessels of other organs, such as the skin.,

An upper medial orbital cleft produces a cleft of the medial one-third of the upper eyelid that extends through the eyebrow into the frontal hairline. The skeletal element of the cleft in the region of the frontal process of the maxilla may either pass lateral to the ethmoid, through the supraorbital rim, or it may pass through the ethmoidal labyrinth to produce orbital hypertelorism. This cleft usually accompanies the Number 3 cleft. The soft tissue features include a cleft of the medial portion of the upper eyelid, an irregularity in hair orientation at the medial end of the eyebrow, and a long tongue-like projection of the frontal hairline onto the forehead. There is a mild flattening of the frontal process of the maxilla and extensive pneumatization of both the ethmoidal and frontal sinuses, both of which are more prominent on the cleft side. No bony clefting of the supraorbital rim or frontal bone is evident. The cranial base and sphenoid architecture, including the pterygoid processes, are symmetric and normal.,

As in the Number 1 and Number 2 clefts, this cleft extends through the lip in the region of the typical cleft lip; however, it does not extend through the base. The cleft continues superiorly to involve the inner canthus and lower eyelid medial to the inferior lacrimal punctum, thereby disrupting the nasolacrimal system. Microphthalmia may be present. The alveolar cleft is between the lateral incisor and the canine. Absent septation between the nasal cavity and maxillary antrum, together with the distortion of the frontal process of the maxilla and lacrimal fossa, produces direct communication between the orbit, maxillary sinus, and nose. There is hypoplasia of the soft tissue margins of the cleft in the vertical dimension. This produces extreme soft tissue deficiency between the alar base and the cleft of the medial aspect of the lower eyelid. The inferior lacrimal punctum is evident at the lateral margin of the lower eyelid cleft. The lacrimal drainage system ends as an opening directly onto the cheek without communication into the nasal cavity. The globe is normal in size, but it is displaced inferiorly and laterally. The nasal septum shows the characteristic distortion seen in typical cleft lip and palate. There is absence of septation between the nasal cavity on the cleft side and the maxilla. The maxilla is hypoplastic in three dimensions, with a marked reduction in pneumatization. Superior extension of the skeletal clefting into the medial portion of the orbital floor and into the inferior orbital rim in the region of the frontal process of the maxilla allows direct communication between the orbit above and the nasomaxillary region below. There is mild narrowing of the ethmoid sinus and of the body of the sphenoid on the cleft side. The pterygoid process appears anatomically normal, but less displaced from the midline compared with that of the noncleft side. Both the orbit and the floor of the anterior cranial fossa are inferiorly displaced.,
As is typically seen in isolated cleft cases, a cleft of the lip is present. There is hypoplasia, but not true notching of the ala nasi with flattening of the lateral part of the nose. The nasal root is broadened, with lateral displacement of the inner canthus. The palpebral fissure and lacrimal drainage system are not disturbed. The alveolar cleft is through the lateral incisor area and extends to the pyriform aperture. There is normal septation between the nasal cavity and maxillary sinus. Notching at the junction between the nasal bone is present, as is a broad, flat frontal process of the maxilla. Transverse ethmoid enlargement produces orbital hypertelorism. Above the cleft of the lip and palate is a true broad cleft of the nostril that is medial to the intact, but laterally displaced, tail of the alar cartilage. A shallow soft tissue groove extends superiorly to the asymmetrically widened nasal root. The lacrimal system, palpebral fissures, and eyebrows remain intact. The alveolar cleft extends posteriorly as a complete unilateral cleft of the hard and soft palate. The nasal septum is intact but deviated to the opposite side. The nasal cavity remains separated from the normally pneumatized, although hypoplastic, maxilla on the cleft side. Above the nasomaxillary notching, the ethmoid sinus is less well developed, and there is no pneumatization of the frontal sinus on this side. Anterior rotation of the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid occurs on the cleft side in relation to the narrower orbit and smaller ethmoid sinus. There is mild asymmetry of the anterior cranial fossa, which is narrower on the cleft side. The cranium is brachycephalic with marked occipital flattening.,
As seen in a typical cleft lip, a cleft of the lip is found in the region of the cupid's bow. The nostril is cleft through the alar dome and extends above onto the nasal dorsum. It passes medial to a normal, but dys- topic, medial canthus. There is an alveolar cleft between the central and lateral incisors that extends above through the pyriform margin lateral to the anterior nasal spine; the nasal septum is not involved. The bony cleft extends through the nasal bone or between the junction of the nasal bone and frontal process of the maxilla. Above the cleft lip, the clefting of the alar dome is associated with deviation to the opposite side of the shortened and broadened columella and nasal tip. Extension of the soft tissue cleft onto the nasal dorsum can be manifest as a series of vertical soft tissue furrows and ridges. Vertical inner canthal dysto- pia and severe telecanthus mark the superior aspect of the Number 1 facial cleft. A cranial soft tissue extension characterized by a tongue-like projection of the frontal hairline delineates the number 13 cleft. Skeletal clefting of the maxilla may extend posteriorly to form a complete cleft of the hard and soft palate. The maxilla is hypoplastic in all three dimensions. There is a keel-shaped alveolus and anterior open bite. Normal septation is preserved between the nasal cavity and the hypoplastic maxillary antrum on the affected side. Distortion of the nasal skeleton produces gross flattening of the nasal dorsum. There is asymmetry of the pterygoid plates, of the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid, and of the floor of the anterior cranial fossa. The distortion of the cranial base may result in a mild plagiocephaly.,

Axonal spheroids are bubble-like biological features that form on most degenerating axons. During neurodegeneration, bubble-like swellings form along the length of the axon, a primary and early effect of dynamic axonal deformation. These varicosities, spheroids, or swellings have been described as beads on a string and branches bearing fruit, and they frequently appear on degenerating axons. The focal swellings on degenerating axons, axonal spheroids, are often filled with cellular debris such as organelles, pathological proteins, and disorganized cytoskeletal elements.,
Ay deviation from the normal distribution of fiber types in skeletal muscle. The skeletal muscle groups of the mammalian body are made up of bundles of muscle fibers. These fibers can be assigned to different Types, with characteristic movement rates, response to neural inputs, and metabolic styles. Skeletal muscle fibers are broadly classified as slow-twitch (type 1) and fast-twitch (type 2). Multiple fiber types are generally intermingled within a single muscle group, and different muscle groups have varying proportions of fiber types,

Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is caused by obstruction of hepatic venous outflow at any level from the small hepatic veins to the junction of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with the right atrium, 1 and occurs in 1/100,000 of the general population worldwide. The most common presentation is with ascites, but can range from fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) to asymptomatic forms. Obstruction of hepatic venous outflow is mainly caused by primary intravascular thrombosis, which can occur suddenly or be repeated over time, accompanied by some revascularization, accounting for the variable parenchymal hepatic damage and histologic presentation. Budd-Chiari syndrome is thus a disease, but since it occurs as a manifestation of several other diseases, this term is kept for the present for convenience.,

Cholangiocarcinoma is a primary cancer originating in the biliary epithelium i.e., the cholangiocytes, of the extrahepatic and intrahepatic biliary ducts. It is extremely invasive, develops rapidly, often metastasizes, and has a very poor prognosis. They are slow growing tumors which spread longitudinally along the bile ducts with neural, perineural and subepithelial extension.,

Cholangitis characterized by a close association between duct branches, usually interlobular bile ducts, and lymphocytic aggregates, which may show a follicular arrangement.,
Cholangitis characterized by the accumulation of granulomas. Granulomas are aggregates of modified macrophages (epithelioid cells) and other inflammatory cells that accumulate after chronic exposure to antigens. The underlying trigger may be exposure to noxious agents that cannot be biochemically degraded or to immune dysfunction. The ultimate result is a release of a variety cytokines that stimulate mononuclear cells that fuse to form multinucleated giant cells with a surrounding rim of lymphocytes and fibroblasts.,
Cholangitis characterized by the presence of numerous polymorphonuclear cells around and within the wall as well as within the lumen of the ducts. This may involve ducts of any size and is occasionally associated with abscess formation (cholangitic abscess).,

Chorea (Greek for 'dance') refers to widespread arrhythmic involuntary movements of a forcible, jerky and restless fashion. It is a random-appearing sequence of one or more discrete involuntary movements or movement fragments. Movements appear random because of variability in timing, duration or location. Each movement may have a distinct start and end. However, movements may be strung together and thus may appear to flow randomly from one muscle group to another. Chorea can involve the trunk, neck, face, tongue, and extremities.,

Cortical myoclonus mainly affects the distal upper limbs and face, which reflects the largest cortical representations of these body areas. It is often focal, but may be multifocal, bilateral or generalized, as a consequence of intracortical and transcallosal spreading of abnormal activity. It typically occurs on voluntary action and may affect speech and gait. Cortical myoclonic jerks are stimulus sensitive, typically to touch, but sensitivity to visual stimuli is also described. Most patients with cortical myoclonus have both positive myoclonus and NM, occurring either independently or together as a complex of the two kinds of myoclonus. If cortical myoclonus is prolonged and lasts for hours, days or weeks, it is called epilepsia partials continua and is considered to be a rare form of focal epileptic status. Focal cortical myoclonus almost always points to an underlining lesion of the sensori-motor cortex, which produces hyperexcitability (e.g. vascular, inflammatory or neoplastic).,

Cranium bifidum
Cranium bifidum occultum, also known as Catlin mark, is a congenital midline skull defect presenting as an enlarged posterior fontanelle in the upper posterior angle of the parietal bone close to the intersection of the sagittal and lambdoid sutures.1, 2, 3 Cranium bifidum occultum occurs due to a defect in intramembranous ossification, a process through which skull bones (frontal, parietal, squamous temporal and occipital bones superior to the mendosal suture) ossify under a vascularized membrane toward the midline to cover the brain.1, 4, 5 Unlike cranium bifidum cysticum, cranium bifidum occultum does not have herniation of intracranial contents. As the skull grows, the midline cranium bifidum occultum defect is separated into bilateral enlarged parietal foramina (EPF) by a midline osseous bridge.,

Duplication of tongue
During normal embryological development, the spinal cord first occupies the entire length of the vertebral column but goes on to assume a position at the level of L1 due to differential growth of the conus medullaris and the vertebral column. The filum terminale is a slender, threadlike structure that remains after the normal regression of the distal embryonic spinal cord and attaches the spinal cord to the coccyx. A tethered cord results if there is a thickened rope-like filum terminale which anchors the cord at the level of L2 or below, potentially causing neurologic signs owing to abnormal tension on the spinal cord.,
During states of inflammation, white blood cells (leukocytes) play a key role in maintaining tissue homeostasis through elimination of pathogens and removal of damaged tissue. Leukocytes migrate to the site of inflammation by crawling over and through the blood vessel wall, into the tissue. This term refers to a defect in the attachment of leukocytes to the blood vessel wall, which is a key step required before they can pass through gaps of the endothelial cells of the blood vessel wall to migrate to the site of inflammation.,

Lesions vary in size from 10 to 25 mm, although occasionally larger tumors of up to 70 mm have been reported. Grossly, tumors appear as well-defined, solitary nodular masses or poorly demarcated lesions. On the cut section, most tumors are cortically located and may extend into the underlying subcortical white matter in larger tumors. Multi-nodular appearance or cystic changes are commonly found,

Dystonic disease
Dystonic gait disorders frequently appear bizarre, particularly because activity increases dystonic tonus and posture. The abnormal posture of the foot in dystonic gait typically involves inversion, plantar flexion and tonic extension of the big toe. In many patients complex types of walking, such as walking backwards and running are paradoxically less impaired than walking forward and may seem completely unaffected. Sensory tricks, for instance, if the affected individual rests a hand on his or her neck, may improve or even normalize dystonic gait in some patients.,

Embolization of intravascular thrombus containing microorganisms into the distant tissues via arterial system.,
Embolization of intravascular thrombus containing microorganisms into the pulmonary parenchyma via arterial system. Septic pulmonary embolism (PE) can be associated with multiple additional clinical manifestations such as fever, tachypnea, and hemoptysis.

Femoral acetabular impingement
Femoral fracture
Femoral hypoplasia
Femoral torsion, also known as femoral rotation or femoral version, refers to the twist between the proximal and distal parts of the femur on the transverse plane. Femoral anteversion averages between 30-40 degress at birth, and between 8-14 degrees in adults. This term applies if the amount of femoral torsion deviates from this range.
Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) results from one or more bony abnormalities that lead to abnormal contact between the acetabulum and the femoral head or neck. The femoral abnormality is proposed to cause compression and shear stresses in the region between the labrum and cartilage, anterosuperiorly. These stresses cause a separation between the labrum and cartilage as the labrum is pushed outwards and the cartilage is pushed centrally. This eventually leads to articular degeneration and eventually global hip osteoarthritis.,

Fine, rapid twitching of individual muscle fibers with little or no movement of the muscle as a whole. If a motor neuron or its axon is destroyed, the muscle fibers it innervates undergo denervation atrophy. This leads to hypersensitivity of individual muscle fibers to acetyl choline so that they may contract spontaneously. Isolated activity of individual muscle fibers is generally so fine it cannot be seen through the intact skin, although it can be recorded as a short-duration spike in the EMG.,

Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) is a non-invasive retinal imaging modality used in clinical practice to provide a density map of lipofuscin, the predominant ocular fluorophore, in the retinal pigment epithelium. Autofluorescent patterns result from the complex interaction of fluorophores such a lipofuscin, which release an autofluorescent signal, and elements such as melanin and rhodopsin, which absorb the excitation beam and attenuate autofluorescence. Other structures such as retinal vessels and the crystalline lens may also influence autofluorescence through blocking and interference.,

Hemiballismus is a rare movement disorder that is caused primarily by damage to various areas in the basal ganglia. Hemiballismus is usually characterized by involuntary flinging motions of the extremities. The movements are often violent and have wide amplitudes of motion. They are continuous and random and can involve proximal and/or distal muscles on one side of the body, while some cases even include the facial muscles. The more a patient is active, the more the movements increase. With relaxation comes a decrease in movements.,

Hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is a benign hepatic tumor. FNH develops within hepatic parenchymal tissue that is otherwise histologically normal. Macroscopically, the tumor is characterized by the presence of depressed, grayish-white scar, which is generally (but not always) located at the center of the lesion, with fibrous septa radiating outward, toward the periphery of the tumor. This stellate scar is found in only 50% of all FNH nodules, but its presence is regarded as pathognomonic. The lesion itself is usually lighter in color than the tissue that surrounds it, and it sometimes has a yellowish hue. FNH nodules are generally not capsulated; their margins are well defined, and they are sometimes lobulated.,

Honeycombing
Honeycombing represents destroyed and fibrotic lung tissue containing numerous cystic airspaces with thick fibrous walls, representing the late stage of various lung diseases, with complete loss of acinar architecture. The cysts range in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter, have variable wall thickness, and are lined by metaplastic bronchiolar epithelium. On chest radiographs, honeycombing appears as closely approximated ring shadows, typically 3-10 mm in diameter with walls 1-3 mm in thickness, that resemble a honeycomb; the finding implies end-stage lung disease. On CT scans, the appearance is of clustered cystic air spaces, typically of comparable diameters on the order of 3-10 mm but occasionally as large as 2.5 cm. Honeycombing is usually subpleural and is characterized by well-defined walls. It is a CT feature of established pulmonary fibrosis. Because honeycombing is often considered specific for pulmonary fibrosis and is an important criterion in the diagnosis of usual interstitial pneumonia, the term should be used with care, as it may directly impact patient care.,

Human Phenotype Ontology
Human Phenotype Ontology Consortium
Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are small oncogenic viruses. HPV has been shown to cause a variety of lesions and malignancies, which predominantly affect the anogenital region. Low-risk, non-oncogenic HPV types are associated with anogenital warts and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis while high-risk, oncogenic types are associated with cervical, penile, anal, vaginal, vulvar, and oropharyngeal cancers. Infection with anogenital HPV is usually asymptomatic and resolves spontaneously without consequences in the immunocompetent host. When disease does occur, the most common manifestation is genital warts, which may be small papules, or flat, smooth or pedunculated lesions. This resolution of HPV lesions is not generally seen in the immunosuppressed, resulting in severe, persistent and extensive manifestations of HPV disease.,

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis involves inhalation of an antigen. This leads to an exaggerated immune response and a following inflammation of the alveoli within the lungs. The main feature of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis on lung biopsies is expansion of the interstitium by lymphocytes accompanied by an occasional multinucleated giant cell or loose granuloma. After exposure to the provoking antigen, following symptoms can be seen
Hypersensitivity that is observed within 1 hr of exposures. A variety of adverse reactions can occur within minutes to hours of exposure to a drug. Some can be related to the pharmacological action of the drug (WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology type A for augmented) and usually have a low mortality. Others are not readily predictable based on the structure and pharmacological action of the drug and have a relatively high mortality risk (Type B for bizarre). The most serious form of immediate onset drug hypersensitivity reaction, anaphylaxis. Other reactions including itching, dizziness/light-headedness, nausea, chest discomfort but without any objective skin features, physical signs or physiological compromise. Skin only reactions include generalized erythema, urticaria or angioedema without any sentinel features (see below) of other organ involvement.,

Hypotonia early
Hypotonia in infancy
Hypotonia is an abnormally low muscle tone (the amount of tension or resistance to movement in a muscle). Even when relaxed, muscles have a continuous and passive partial contraction which provides some resistance to passive stretching. Hypotonia thus manifests as diminished resistance to passive stretching. Hypotonia is not the same as muscle weakness, although the two conditions can co-exist.,

Impairment in a child's ability to be able to play in a way that involves peer collaboration. Collaborative play involves things such as verbal and non-verbal communication (e.g., self-initiated interactions), turn-taking, sharing, reciprocity, and collaborative problem-solving. It is often contrasted to parallel play, which involves a form of social play in which two children do similar activities near each other and often mimic each other. Typically developing children develop collaborative play between the ages of 4 and 5.

In a Number 10 Tessier cleft there is an upper central orbital cleft with a cleft of the middle one-third of the upper eyelid, which often results in total ablepharia. The eyebrow is disrupted, being virtually absent medially, whereas the lateral portion angles upward toward the frontal hairline. There may be ocular anomalies, including colobomata of the iris. The skeletal cleft is through the midportion of the supraorbital rim, the adjacent frontal bone, and the orbital roof lateral to the supraorbital nerve. A frontal encephalocele frequently occupies the frontal bony cleft. The palpebral fissure is grossly elongated with an amblyopic eye displaced inferiorly and laterally. There is also a divergent squint of the right eye. The eyebrow is deficient medially and becomes thinned out laterally , where it is contiguous with a broad downward and forward projection of the frontotemporal hairline (this may be seen in both the Number 9 and 10 clefts.) A broad frontal encephalocele bulges forward from the middle one-third of the right forehead, supraorbital ridge, and orbital roof. The bony cleft, through which the frontal encephalocele presents, involves the anterior half of the orbital roof, the supraorbital rim, and two-thirds of the vertical height of the frontal bone lateral to the supraorbital nerve. The bony orbit is inferiorly displaced and widened with the lateral orbital wall shortened and laterally deviated. Similar distortion of the anterior cranial fossa is evident, being broader and more flattened on the affected side. The calvarium above the level of the cleft and the cranial base below is symmetric.,
In a heliotrope rash, the color of the skin turns to violet, which is the color of the heliotrope flower.
In a medical encounter, the physician generally will interview the patient about his or her current problem, and may perform additional testing. The past medical history (PMH) in contrast records information about the patient's medical, personal and family history that might be relevant to the presenting illness or to provide optimal clinical management. The PMH generally includes (if relevant) other major illnesses, hospitalizations, surgeries, injuries, allergies, gynecologic and obstetric history, family history, personal history including occupational history, alcohol and drug use, etc.
In clinical parlance, findings are occasionally interpreted as being distinctive or minor, reflecting a subjective clinical impression of the importance of a feature for the differential diagnosis. A minor finding is taken to be one that is likely to have high utility in distinguishing the correct diagnosis from other candidates in the differential.

In contrast to forms of polydactyly where the supernumerary digit (this can either be a rudimentary or a completely 'normal' digit) is either located postaxial (on the fibular side of the foot, next top the little toe), preaxial (on the tibial side of the foot, next to the big toe) or mesoaxial (somewhere central, between big and little toe), a supernumerary digit may also be placed ectopically, meaning anywhere else except post-,meso- or preaxial. In the literature this is sometimes referred to as Disorganisation-like Syndrome (OMIM223200).,
In contrast to forms of polydactyly where the supernumerary digit (this can either be a rudimentary or a completely 'normal' digit) is either located postaxial (on the ulnar side of the hand, next to the little finger), preaxial (on the radial side of the hand, next to the thumb) or mesoaxial (somewhere central, between thumb and little finger), a supernumerary digit may also be placed ectopically, meaning anywhere else except post-,meso- or preaxial. In the literature this is sometimes referred to as Disorganisation-like Syndrome (OMIM223200).,
In contrast to the metacarpals 2-5, the first metacarpal is embryologically of phalangeal origin and as such equivalent to the proximal phalanges of the digits 2-5 (whereas the proximal phalanx of the thumb is equivalent to the middle phalanges of the other digits). The epiphysis of the first metacarpal is localized at the proximal end (as seen in the proximal phalanges of the other digits), whereas the epiphyses of the other metacarpal bones are located at the distal end. This term applies if the epiphysis of the 1st metacarpal is in any way abnormal, referring to age and gender depending norms, as seen on x-rays.,
In contrast to the metatarsals 2-5, the first metatarsal is embryologically of phalangeal origin and as such equivalent to the proximal phalanges of the digits 2-5, whereas the proximal phalanx of the big toe is equivalent to the middle phalanges of the other digits. This term applies to abnormalities affecting the proximal phalanx of the hallux.,

This term applies to abnormalities of the epiphysis of the first metatarsal bone.,
In left atrial isomerism there is a bilateral small finger-shaped morphologically left atrial appendage joining the atrial chamber along a narrow front without an internal terminal crest.,
In newborns, the two frontal bones, two parietal bones, and one occipital bone are joined by fibrous sutures, which form a small posterior fontanelle, and a larger, diamond-shaped anterior fontanelle. These regions allow for the skull to pass the birth canal and for later growth. The fontanelles gradually ossify, whereby the posterior fontanelle usually closes by eight weeks and the anterior fontanelle by the 9th to 16th month of age. Large fontanelles are diagnosed if the fontanelles are larger than age-dependent norms.,
In otherwise healthy smokers, characteristic so called smoker-inclusion can be found within the macrophages in the bronchoalveolar fluid. These blue/ black/ round/ oval cytoplasmic inclusions consist of pigmented lipid deposits.,
In otosclerosis, a callus of bone accumulates on the stapes creating a partial fixation. This limits the movement of the stapes bone, which results in hearing loss.,
In primary position, the eyes drift slowly downward and then spontaneously beat upward. Upward gaze accentuates the nystagmus. The associated oscillopsias are often very irritating, but the symptoms are usually transient.,
In response to the spring sun distinct inflamed reddened skin develops on the ears, nose, cheeks, fingers, backs of the hands, and the lower arms, on which blisters with serous or hemorrhagic content develop. These dry out with the formation of a blackish scab. After shedding of the scab, depressed, varioliform, often hypopigmented scars remain. In addition, hyper- and hypopigmentation are present together, resulting in a polymorphous skin presentation.,
In the NBT test, neutrophils change the colorless compound NBT into a compound with a deep blue color. If this test is negative (i.e., no blue color is produced), then this indicates a defect in superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase activity with inability to efficiently kill phagocytized bacteria.,
In the normal heart cycle, two heart sounds can be heard by auscultation per cycle
In the resting position, the tip of the thumb is on, or near, the palm, close to the base of the fourth or fifth finger.,
In this case the right ventricle is more muscular than normal, causing a characteristic boot-shaped (coeur-en-sabot) appearance as seen on anterior- posterior chest x-rays. Right ventricular hypertrophy is commonly associated with any form of right ventricular outflow obstruction or pulmonary hypertension, which may in turn owe its origin to left-sided disease. The echocardiographic signs are thickening of the anterior right ventricular wall and the septum. Cavity size is usually normal, or slightly enlarged. In many cases there is associated volume overload present due to tricuspid regurgitation, in the absence of this, septal motion is normal.,
In type E brachydactyly, shortening of the fingers is mainly in the metacarpals and metatarsals.,
In type IV atherosclerotic lesions a dense accumulation of extracellular lipid occupies an extensive but well-defined region of the intima. This type of extracellular lipid accumulation is known as the lipid core. A fibrous tissue increase is not a feature, and complications such as defects of the lesion surface and thrombosis are not present. The type IV lesion is also known as atheroma. Type IV is the first lesion considered advanced in this classification because of the severe intimal disorganization caused by the lipid core. The characteristic core appears to develop from an increase and the consequent confluence of the small isolated pools of extracellular lipid that characterize type III lesions. The increase in lipid is believed to result from continued insudation from the plasma. Type IV lesions, when they first appear in younger people, are found in the same locations as adaptive intimal thickenings of the eccentric type. Thus, atheroma is, at least initially, an eccentric lesion.,
In utero growth retardation
In utero, the ductus arteriosus (DA) serves to divert ventricular output away from the lungs and toward the placenta by connecting the main pulmonary artery to the descending aorta. A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in the first 3 days of life is a physiologic shunt in healthy term and preterm newborn infants, and normally is substantially closed within about 24 hours after bith and completely closed after about three weeks. Failure of physiologcal closure is referred to a persistent or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Depending on the degree of left-to-right shunting, PDA can have clinical consequences.,
In wound repair, neovascularization (NV) involves the sprouting of new vessels from pre-existent vessels to repair or replace damaged vessels. In the retina, NV is a response to ischemia. The NV adheres to the inner surface of the retina and outer surface of the vitreous. NV are deficient in tight junctions and hence leak plasma into surrounding tissue including the vitreous. Plasma causes the vitreous gel to degenerate, contract, and eventually collapse which pulls on the retina. Since retinal NV is adherent to both retina and vitreous, as the vitreous contracts the NV may be sheared resulting in vitreous hemorrhage or the NV may remain intact and pull the retina with the vitreous resulting in retinal elevation referred to as traction retinal detachment.,

Intralobular septal thickening is a computed tomography finding of increased width of the walls (septa) within a pulmonary lobule. Secondary pulmonary lobules represent a cluster of up to 30 acini 9 supplied by a common distal pulmonary artery and bronchiole. These clustered acini are bounded by interstitial fibrous septa (interlobular septa) which outline an irregular polyhedron of varying size between 1 and 2.5 cm. Interlobular septal thickening is seen on chest radiographs as thin linear opacities at right angles to and in contact with the lateral pleural surfaces near the lung bases. In contrast, intralobular septal thickening are visible as fine linear opacities in a lobule when the intralobular interstitial tissue is abnormally thickened. When numerous, they may appear as a fine reticular pattern.,

Lactase is produced in the small intestine in humans, Lactase is a member of the beta-galactosidase family of enzymes, and hydrolyzes D-lactose to form D-galactose and D-glucose, which can be absorbed by the small intestine. There are many ways of assessing lactase activity. In one test, an endoscopic biopsy from the postbulbar duodenum is incubated with lactose on a test plate, and a color reaction develops within 20 min as a result of hydrolyzed lactose (a positive result) in patients with normolactasia, whereas no reaction (a negative result) develops in patients with severe hypolactasia. Other, less direct, tests include the hydrogen breath test, and blood tests following lactose challenges.

Leukoplakia is a precancerous dermatosis of mucous membranes analogous Leukoplakia is basically a chronic inflammatory hypertrophy in which anaplasia and malignant dyskeratosis may develop and subsequently advance to an invasive squamous cell cancer. The clinical diagnosis of primary anal leukoplakia is indicated by single or multiple slightly raised,irregular, marginated, grayish-white keratinized' patches in the anal canal. Tissue biopsy is necessary for confirmation.,

Lipofuscin (age pigment) is a brown-yellow, electron-dense, autofluorescent material that accumulates progressively over time in lysosomes of postmitotic cells, such as neurons and cardiac myocytes. This term pertains if there is an increase in the accumulation of lipofuscin (also known as autofluorescent lipoprotein) more than expected for the age of the patient.,
Lipofuscin, a generic term applied to autofluorescent lipopigment, is a mixture of protein and lipid that accumulates in most aging cells, particularly those involved in high lipid turnover (e.g., the adrenal medulla) or phagocytosis of other cell types (e g., the retinal pigment epithelium or RPE; macrophage). This term pertains if there is an increase in the extraneuronal accumulation of lipofuscin (also known as autofluorescent lipoprotein) more than expected for the age of the patient.,

Livedo racemosa describes a reddish-blue mottling of the skin in an irregular, reticular pattern. It differs from the more common livedo reticularis by its shape. Livedo racemosa consists of broken circular segments resulting in a seemingly larger pattern, as opposed to the fine, regular, complete network of livedo reticularis. Livedo racemosa results from permanent impairment of peripheral blood flow and, unlike livedo reticularis, it persists on warming.,
Livedo reticularis is characterized by the presence of a bluish purple, mottled or netlike pattern in unbroken circles on the skin. Exposure to cold environments usually intensifies the vascular pattern. Presumably, the condition results from slow or stagnant blood flow, vessel-wall pathology, and decreased oxygen tension.

Lumbar gibbus deformity
Lumbar lordosis
Lumbar puncture relieves symptoms
Lumbar spinal stenoses may induce symptoms following an individually typical latency on standing or when walking due to swelling of the cauda equina, which leads to compression. This is referred to as neurogenic claudication. The symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis can be explained by an increase in lumbar lordosis and spinal canal stenosis in an upright position compared to the sitting position or if spondylolisthesis is present by a shift of the vertebrae while standing and walking. Following an individually characteristic distance, walking becomes associated with deep muscular pain and with neurological deficits, such as sensory deficits and paresis in the lower limbs, which resolve within minutes when the affected person sits or lies down. Activities performed in a flexed posture, such as cycling often cause less problems than walking. For the same reason, walking uphill may be tolerated better than walking downhill. Clinical neurological examination at rest may be entirely normal but there is usually pain on hyperextension of the lumbar spine.,

Majocchi's granuloma (MG) is an inflammatory and granulomatous, dermatophytic infection characterized by a granulomatous inflammation around the hair follicle. Histopathologically, MG demonstrates a nodular perifollicular granulomatous infiltrate of lymphoid cells, macrophages, epithelioid cells, multinucleated giant cells, and neutrophils. Unlike superficial dermatophytoses, fungal hyphae and spores can be detected not only on the surface of the epidermis but also within or around the hair follicles.,

Molluscoid pseudotumor
Molluscum contagiosum is a cutaneous viral infection that is commonly observed in both healthy and immunocompromised children. The infection is caused by a member of the Poxviridae family, the molluscum contagiosum virus. Molluscum contagiosum presents as single or multiple small white or flesh-colored papules that typically have a central umbilication. The central umbilication may be difficult to observe in young children and, instead, may bear an appearance similar to an acneiform eruption. The lesions vary in size (from 1 mm to 1 cm in diameter) and are painless, although a subset of patients report pruritus in the area of infection. On average, 11-20 papules appear on the body during the course of infection and generally remains a self-limiting disease. However, in immunosuppressed patients, molluscum contagiosum can be a severe infection with hundreds of lesions developing on the body. Extensive eruption is indicative of an advanced immunodeficiency state.,

Nausea
Nausea and vomiting
Nausea is a commonly encountered symptom that has been defined as an unpleasant painless subjective feeling that one will imminently vomit. Vomiting has been defined as the forceful expulsion of the contents of the stomach, duodenum, or jejunum through the oral cavity. While nausea and vomiting are often thought to exist on a temporal continuum, this is not always the case. There are situations when severe nausea may be present without emesis and less frequently, when emesis may be present without preceding nausea.,

Normal adult hemoglobin is composed of two chains each of alpha and beta globin. Hb Barts (Hemoglobin Barts) is a tetramer with four gamma globin chains, and is essentially pathognomonic for one or another form of alpha thalassemia. Hb Barts has an extremely high affinity for oxygen, resulting in almost no oxygen delivery to the tissues.,

Normally, the aortic valve closure (A2) is followed by the pulmonic valve closure (P2) but the A2-P2 interval increases with inspiration and decreases with expiration. With paradoxical splitting, there is a delay in the closure of the aortic valve, so that A2 can follow P2; the individual components can be appreciated at the end of expiration and the interval narrows with inspiration (which is the oposite of the normal pattern).
Normally, the posterior and lateral fontanelles are obliterated by about six months after birth, the anterior fontanelle closes by about the middle of the second year. This term refers to the situation in which the fontanelles close at an inappropriately early time point.,

Oligemia is a reduction in pulmonary blood volume. Most frequently, this reduction is regional, but occasionally it is generalized. Regional oligemia is usually associated with reduced blood flow in the oligemic area. Oligemia appears as a regional or widespread decrease in the size and number of identifiable pulmonary vessels, which is indicative of less than normal blood flow.,

Oligodendroglioma is a type of diffusely infiltrating glioma and constitutes approximately 5% of primary intracranial tumors. They often involve the cortical gray matter and are most commonly seen in the frontal lobes. OGs are generally low grade WHO grade II neoplasms that are slow-growing tumors and have a favorable treatment response when compared to other gliomas. Grade III anaplastic OG is a more malignant form of the tumor which portends a less favorable prognosis and may occur de novo or as degeneration from the lower grade OG.,

On chest radiographs, ground-glass opacity appears as an area of hazy increased lung opacity, usually extensive, within which\nmargins of pulmonary vessels may be indistinct. On CT scans, it appears as hazy increased opacity of lung, with preservation of bronchial and vascular margins. It is caused by partial filling of airspaces, interstitial thickening (due to fluid, cells, and/or fibrosis), partial collapse of alveoli, increased capillary blood volume, or a combination of these, the common factor being the partial displacement of air. Ground-glass opacity is less opaque than consolidation, in which bronchovascular margins are obscured.,
On computed tomography of the brain,the white (or dense) cerebellum sign is seen when the cerebellum appears dense with respect to the cerebral parenchyma. The increase in attenuation of cerebellum is in fact a relative hyperdensity caused by decreased attenutation of the brain. It represents anoxic-ischemic cerebral injury, and has a very poor prognosis.,
On prenatal ultrasound, the nasal bone is a thin echogenic line within the bridge of the fetal nose. The fetus is imaged facing the transducer with the fetal face strictly in the midline. The angle of insonation is 90 degrees, with the longitudinal axis of the nasal bone as the reference line. Calibres are placed at each end of the nasal bone. Absence of the nasal bone or measurements below 2.5th percentile are considered significant (PMID

Organizing pneumonia manifests as a histologic pattern characterized by loose plugs of connective tissue in the airspaces and distal airways. Interstitial inflammation and fibrosis are minimal or absent. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, or COP, is a distinctive clinical disorder among the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, but the histologic pattern of organizing pneumonia is encountered in many different situations, including pulmonary infection, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and collagen vascular diseases. Airspace consolidation is the cardinal feature of organizing pneumonia on chest radiographs and CT scans. In COP, the distribution is typically subpleural and basal and sometimes bronchocentric. Other manifestations of organizing pneumonia include groundglass opacity, tree-in-bud pattern, and nodular opacities.,

Pheochromocytomas usually originate from the adrenal medulla but may also develop from chromaffin cells in or about sympathetic ganglia. A common symptom of pheochromocytoma is hypertension owing to release of catecholamines.,

Platelet abnormalities
Platelet aggregation defect
Platelet antibody
Platelets are replete with secretory granules, which are critical to normal platelet function. Among the three types of platelet secretory granules - alpha-granules, dense granules, and lysosomes - the alpha-granule is the most abundant. Granule contents must be released from their intracellular repository in order to achieve their physiologic function, and this term refers to a functional defect in granule secretion.,
Platelets contain contractile proteins (actin and myosin) that induce clot retraction. As the platelets contract, they pull on the surrounding fibrin strands, squeezing serum form the mass, compacting the clot and drawing the ruptured edges of the blood vessel more closely together. Clot retraction is directly proportional to the platelet count and inversely proportional to the fibrinogen concentration.
Platelike atelectasis

Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (PXA) are rare low-grade astrocytomas (WHO Grade II) typically found in the temporal lobe and classically presenting with epilepsy. PXA is an astrocytic neoplasm that most often presents in children or young adults but can also occur in adults. The diagnosis of anaplastic PXA is made based upon tumor histopathologic characteristics and requires increased proliferative activity (mitotic index at least 5 mitoses/10 HPF), which is associated with worse overall survival. In general, anaplastic PXAs acquire features of a more aggressive astrocytic neoplasm that can include increased proliferation, necrosis, microvascular proliferation, loss of pericellular reticulin, and increased infiltrative growth.,

Pronuclei formation is a critical process during fertilisation. Normally, there are two pronuclei (2PN), including the paternal pronucleus and the maternal pronucleus, in the zygote after fertilisation. It is generally accepted that multiple pronuclei (MPN) formation is due to the abnormal extrusion of the second polar body or to abnormal fertilisation with multiple sperm. The MPN therefore can cause infertility and recurrent failure of IVF/ICSI.,

Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are an important cause of apparently treatment-resistant epilepsy and remain a major diagnostic challenge in epileptology. The two main PNES groups are panic disorder (also occurring as a reaction in people with epilepsy) and dissociative disorder (pseudoseizure), often developing inpatients with no history of epilepsy. The main markers distinguishing PNES from epileptic seizures are (i) the way the patient tells the story (not focusing on the seizure symptoms, avoidance of the word seizure, etc); (ii) that they are prolonged (many minutes); (iii) associated with hyperventilation and eyes closed; and that they present as treatment-resistant epilepsy despite an often normal intellect and brain imaging.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension crisis
Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation, a condition most commonly associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, is an abnormal communication between the pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein without an intervening capillary communication. HRCT images usually show a coarse spidery appearance of the peripheral vascular markings in the lungs. More specific findings are obtained in the pulmonary angiogram where the normally invisible capillary phase is replaced by irregular vascular channels bridging the peripheral branches of pulmonary arteries and veins.,
Pulmonary artery hypertension
Pulmonary aspiration,
Pulmonary atelectasis

Pulmonary blood flow redistribution refers to any departure from the normal distribution of blood flow in the lungs that is caused by an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance elsewhere in the pulmonary vascular bed. Pulmonary blood flow redistribution is indicated by a decrease in the size and/or number of visible pulmonary vessels in one or more lung regions, with a corresponding increase in number and/or size of pulmonary vessels in other parts of the lung.,
Pulmonary bullae
Pulmonary bullae are rounded focal regions of emphysema with a thin wall which measure more than 1 cm in diameter. They are often subpleural in location and are typically larger in the apices. In some cases, bullae can be very large and result in compression of adjacent lung tissue. A giant bulla is arbitrarily defined as one that occupies at least one third of the volume of a hemithorax. When large, bullae can simulate pneumothorax. The most common cause is paraseptal emphysema but bullae may also be seen in association with centrilobular emphysema.,

Pulmonary haemorrhage
Pulmonary hemangiomas
Pulmonary hemorrhage is a bleeding within the lungs. Older children and adults may spit blood or bloody sputum. Neonates, infants and young children usually do not spit up blood. Anemia, pulmonary infiltrates, increasingling bloody return on BAL and the presence of hemosiderin-laden macrophages in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid or lung biopsy can diagnose lung bleeding. Alveolar macrophages contain phagocytosed red blood cells and stain positive for hemosiderin, a product of hemoglobin degradation, after about 48-72 hours following pulmonary hemorraghe. Previous or recurrent bleeding can thus be distinguished from fresh events. A differentiation into local or diffuse is of importance. Also differentiate if pulmonary hemorrhage is due to a primary lung disorder or a manifestation of a systemic disease.,
Pulmonary hypertension is defined mean pulmonary artery pressure of 25mmHg or more and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 15mmHg or less when measured by right heart catheterisation at rest and in a supine position.,

Radial dysplasia, also known as radial longitudinal deficiency, includes radial clubhand and is a disfiguring, and potentially disabling, congenital limb anomaly. The entire upper limb may be involved, although the defect is most evident in the forearm and hand. Affected children suffer a variable degree of hypoplasia or absence of the preaxial skeleton and soft tissues, in particular the thumb, radius, and dorsoradial soft tissues. The hand is usually radially deviated and subluxated off the distal aspect of the ulna, the ulna may be shortened and have a bow-shaped deformity, and there is no true wrist (radiocarpal) joint in Bayne2 type-III and IV radial dysplasia.,

Rickets is divided into two major categories including calcipenic and phosphopenic. Hypophosphatemia is described as a common manifestation of both categories. Hypophosphatemic rickets is the most common type of rickets that is characterized by low levels of serum phosphate, resistance to ultraviolet radiation or vitamin D intake. There are several issues involved in hypophosphatemic rickets such as calcium, vitamin D, phosphorus deficiencies. Moreover, other disorder can be associated with its occurrence such as absorption defects due to pancreatic, intestinal, gastric, and renal disorders and hepatobiliary disease. Symptoms are usually seen in childhood and can be varied in severity. Severe forms may be linked to bowing of the legs, poor bone growth, and short stature as well as joint and bone pain. Hypophosphatemic rickets are associated with renal excretion of phosphate, hypophosphatemia, and mineral defects in bones. The familial type of the disease is the most common type of rickets.,

Rounded atelectasis is rounded collapsed lung associated with invaginated fibrotic pleura and thickened and fibrotic interlobular septa. Most frequently, it is the consequence of an asbestos-induced exudative pleural effusion with resultant pleural scarring, but it may occur with any cause of pleural fibrosis. On chest radiographs, rounded atelectasis appears as a mass abutting a pleural surface, usually in the posterior part of a lower lobe. Distorted vessels have a curvilinear disposition as they converge on the mass (the comet tail sign). The degree of lobar retraction depends on the volume of atelectatic lung. It is almost invariably associated with other signs of pleural fibrosis (eg, blunting of costophrenic angle). CT is more sensitive for the detection and display of the characteristic features of rounded atelectasis. An additional sign is homogeneous uptake of contrast medium in the atelectatic lung.,

The cleft lip is midway between the philtral ridge and the commissure of the mouth. The cleft is lateral to the normally shaped and placed nasal ala and passes onto the cheek. The cleft extends through the lower eyelid lateral to the punctum. The lacrimal system and inner canthus are normal. Microphthalmia may be present. The alveolar cleft passes between the lateral incisor and canine, as in the Number 3 cleft. The cleft passes around the pyriform aperture and continues through the portion of the maxillary sinus medial to the infraorbital foramen. The cleft terminates at the medial end of the inferior orbital rim. There is severe vertical soft tissue deficiency in a Number 4 cleft, with the medial margins of the cleft lip extending directly into the medially placed cleft of the lower eyelid. Within the medial segment of the right-sided cleft lip, muscle elements are apparently absent. Muscle bunching is noted in the ipsilateral lateral lip segment, as is seen in a typical unilateral cleft lip. The anatomically normal nasal ala is superiorly displaced in association with a severe deficiency in the overall nasal length. Marked dystopia of the right globe results in its inferior displacement into the medially deficient orbital floor and inferior rim. Both globes are otherwise normal. The complete palatal cleft passes through the maxilla medial to the infraorbital foramen and extends to the medial portion of the inferior orbital rim without evidence of an intact maxillary sinus. Bony septation persists medially, thereby separating the nasal cavity from the orbit, maxillary sinus, and mouth, which are contiguous. Marked midfacial hypoplasia is present. The cleft is manifest as asymmetry of the body of the sphenoid; it is smaller on the right, with asymmetric placement of the pterygoid plates relative to the midline. The orbital floor cleft has no communication with the inferior orbital fissure. The cleft does not extend to the skull base, but there is marked facial asymmetry associated with plagiocephaly.,
The cleft of the lip is just medial to the oral commissure and extends across the cheek as a furrow. It ends as a cleft at the junction of the middle and lateral third of the lower eyelid. Microphthalmia is frequently present. The alveolar cleft is through the premolar region and extends superiorly through the orbit at the inferolateral part of the rim and floor. There is a vertical soft tissue deficiency between the lateral portion of the lip and the lower eyelid cleft. The left side of the nose shows vertical shortening, and the left alar base is displaced superiorly. Facial asymmetry secondary to the skeletal abnormality is reflected by a vertical orbital dystopia. However, bothglobes are normal, and there is no abnormality of the upper eyelids, eyebrow, forehead, or frontal hairline. The skeletal clefts vary, ranging from a narrow skeletal furrow that traverses the anterior maxillary wall as on the rightto a broad cleft of the maxilla lateral to the infraorbital foramen and maxillary sinus. This latter cleft enters the inferolateral orbital rim and floor without posterior communication with the inferior orbital fissure on the left side. Medial collapse of the lateral maxillary segments is present bilaterally, with reduction in the transverse dimensions of the maxillary arch. Manifestations of the skeletal disturbance in the sphenoid include a shortening and thickening of the lateral orbital walls in the region of the greater wing and mild asymmetric placement of the pterygoid plates relative to the midline. The right-sided pterygoid plates are smaller and closer to the midline. There is minimal asymmetry of the cranial base and calvarium.,

The frontozygomatic or Number 8 cleft is found in both Treacher Collins syndrome and the Goldenhar variant of hemifacial microsomia. Skeletal defects are more prominent in Treacher Collins syndrome, whereas the soft tissue clefting is more typical in cases of ''Goldenhar syndrome''. Soft tissue clefting presents as a dermatocele, a true lateral eyelid coloboma with absence of the outer canthus, and anomalies of the globe itself, especially epibulbar cysts in patients with Goldenhar syndrome. The frontozygomatic bony cleft produces absence of the lateral orbital rim; this border now is formed by the hypoplastic greater wing of the sphenoid. The absence of bony support for the outer canthus produces lateral canthal dystopia and the characteristic antimongoloid slant of the palpebral fissures. Secondary to the bony deficiency in the lateral orbital wall and floor, there is soft tissue continuity between the orbit, temporal fossa, and infratemporal region. Preauricular hairline indicators delineate the Number 8 cleft as the first of the northbound clefts. Complete absence of the bony lateral orbital wall and rim constitute the skeletal element of the Number 8 cleft. The lateral border of the orbit is formed by the greater wing of the sphenoid from which small spicules of bone, which represent the rudimentary zygoma, may be found in Treacher Collins syndrome. The symmetry of the facial anomalies is reflected in the apparently normal symmetric anterior and middle cranial fossae.,

The jugular lymphatic sacs (JLS) are a physiological and temporary part of fetal lymphatic development. They are formed from small buds of lymphatic endothelial cells arising from the internal jugular veins. By 14 weeks gestation they have developed into lymphatic nodes which drain into the systemic circulation. Visibility of JLS on ultrasound past 14 weeks of gestation implies distension and this may be associated with raised nuchal translucency.,
The kidney contributes towards acid-base homeostasis by excreting H+ ions and retaining bicarbonate. This process is known as acidification of the urine.

The anatomy of the sphenoid is abnormal, especially on the right where there is no recognizable medial or lateral pterygoid plate.,
The term Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) was initially used for patients diagnosed with fasting hyperglycemia that could be treated without insulin for more than two years, where the initial diagnosis was made at a young age (under 25 years). Thus, MODY combines characteristics of type 1 diabetes (young age at diagnosis) and type 2 diabetes (less insulin dependence than type 1 diabetes). The term MODY is now most often used to refer to a group of monogenic diseases with these characteristics. Here, the term is used to describe hyperglycemia diagnosed at a young age with no or minor insulin dependency, no evidence of insulin resistence, and lack of evidence of autoimmune destruction of the beta cells.,

The term bilingual aphasia is used to refer to aphasia in persons who speak two or more languages. When a multilingual speaker has aphasia following a stroke, the languages spoken premorbidly may show comparable or differential patterns of impairment. Differential patterns may manifest as greater impairment in one language compared to another, or as differences in the characteristics of aphasia. Clinical reports of bilingual aphasia show dissociations in the processing of the language learned first (L1) and and second (L2), with one language more impaired than the other. Other cases show a pattern of differential recovery where L2 is recovered only after L1. Another pattern is alternating antagonism; i.e., patients access one language in spontaneous speech and inhibit the other language for alternating periods. This term should be used for a type of aphasia in a person who speaks multiple languages in which the impairment is different for different languages.,
The term collodion baby applies to newborns who appear to have an extra layer of skin (known as a collodion membrane) that has a collodion-like quality. It is a descriptive term, not a specific diagnosis or disorder (as such, it is a syndrome). Affected babies are born in a collodion membrane, a shiny waxy outer layer to the skin. This is shed 10-14 days after birth, revealing the main symptom of the disease, extensive scaling of the skin caused by hyperkeratosis. With increasing age, the scaling tends to be concentrated around joints in areas such as the groin, the armpits, the inside of the elbow and the neck. The scales often tile the skin and may resemble fish scales.,

The vestibulo-ocular reflex is responsible for the stabilization of the retinal image during movement. The visual vestibular ocular reflex (VVOR) or visual enhanced VOR, maintains ocular stability during head motion by generating compensatory eye movement opposite to head movement, and is a major component of visual vestibular interaction. This feature is an impairment of this reflex, manifested as the combined impairment of the three compensatory eye movement reflexes, namely the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), smooth pursuit (SP) and optokinetic reflex (OKR).,

Thenar abnormality
Thenar atrophy
Thenar hypoplasia
Thenar muscle hypoplasia
There is a paramedian frontal encephalocele and a soft tissue cleft that passes medial to an intact eyebrow. The frontal bone shows a paramedian bony cleft with an associated encephalocele. The olfactory groove, cribriform plate, and ethmoid sinus are all increased in transverse diameter, resulting in hypertelorism. The cleft extends medially to the undisturbed eyebrow to end in a short paramedian frontal widow's peak. The bony cleft begins in the region of the nasal bone and extends superiorly through the full height of the frontal bone. Posteriorly, the cleft extends through the cribriform plate and ethmoid sinus as far as the lesser wing and body of the sphenoid. The pterygoid processes are anatomically normal, but they are displaced laterally from the midline on the cleft side. There is orbital hypertelorism below and asymmetry of the floor of the anterior cranial fossa above.,
There is a soft tissue cleft medial to the inner canthus with a cleft of the root of the eyebrow. The frontal process of the maxilla is flat and broadened, and the ethmoid labyrinth is increased in tranverse dimension, thereby producing orbital hypertelorism. The cribriform plate is of normal width. The frontal sinus is enlarged. Even though the frontal bone is flattened, bony clefts with encephalocele have not been observed. There is a lateral displacement of the inner canthus with a mild thinning, aplasia, or irregularity of the medial end of the eyebrow. There are no eyelid clefts. The soft tissue contour of the forehead is normal, with only a short downward prolongation of the paramedian frontal hairline to mark the superior extent of the soft tissue cleft. Flattening of the frontal process of the maxilla, an increase in the transverse dimension of the ethmoid sinus, and a laterally convex bowing of the medial orbital wall produce orbital hypertelorism. Superiorly there is a minor flattening of the frontal bone medially, and the nasofrontal angle is somewhat obtuse. The extensive pneumatization of the sinuses on the cleft side extends backward through the frontal and ethmoid sinuses and into the sphenoid sinus. The anatomy of the sphenoid, including the pterygoid processes, is otherwise normal. The anterior and middle cranial fossae floors are both broadened on the cleft side with minor widening of the cribriform plate.,

This anomaly, also known as Mittendorf dot, is a benign, nonprogressive recognizable lesion that does not cause visual impairment. However, it can resemble a pathological congenital or acquired cataract lesion which may enlarge and cause visual impairment. The dot appears as a black speck that ranges in size from the dot made by a sharp pencil point to the size of a poppy seed. It is usually well defined, although occasionally there may be irregular, fine lines radiating outward from the dot.
This applies to an individual who needs help with dressing or needs to be completely dressed.,
This condition is caused by slow-growing conglomeration of dust particles and collagen deposition in individuals (mostly coal workers) heavily exposed to inorganic dust. Progressive massive fibrosis manifests as masslike lesions, usually bilateral and in\nthe upper lobes. Background nodular opacities reflect accompanying pneumoconiosis, with or without emphysematous destruction adjacent to the massive fibrosis. Lesions similar to progressive massive fibrosis sometimes occur in other conditions, such as sarcoidosis and talcosis.,

This finding is a thin curvilinear opacity, 1-3 mm in thickness, lying less than 1 cm from and parallel to the pleural surface. It corresponds to atelectasis of normal lung if seen in the dependent posteroinferior portion of lung of a patient in the supine position and is subsequently shown to disappear on CT sections acquired with the patient prone. It may also be encountered in patients with pulmonary edema or fibrosis (other signs are usually present).,
This finding is composed of a ring-shaped opacity representing a dilated bronchus in cross section and a smaller adjacent opacity representing its pulmonary artery, with the combination resembling a signet (or pearl) ring. It is the basic sign of bronchiectasis in pulmonary computed tomography imaging.,

This is a description previously used to describe a facial form characterized by a short, upturned nose, wide mouth, widely spaced eyes, and full cheeks. Because of the imprecision in this definition it is preferable to describe these features precisely. This term is retained because it was often used in the past, but it should not be used for new annotations.,
This is a general term that denotes a reduced ability to perform the work that one performed prior to an illness, and may be related to pain, cognitive dysfunction, fatigue or other physical disabilities.
This is a postural deformity in which the foot is positioned up against the tibia. The heel (calcaneus) is positioned downward (that is, the ankle is flexed upward), and the heel is turned outward (valgus).,
This is an upper lateral orbital cleft. The soft tissue deformity is in the lateral one-third of the upper eyelid, and the bony cleft is through the superolateral orbital angle. Microphthalmia is present. The superolateral bony deficiency of the orbits allows a lateral displacement of the globes. The lateral one-third of the upper eyelid and the outer canthus are distorted, thus preventing apposition to the globe. The upper eyelid does not have a true cleft. A soft tissue furrow radiates superiorly and posterisphenoid is symmetric and normal. Mild cranial base asymmetry is reflected in the pterygoid plates. The left pair is more laterally displaced from the midline. Skull vault plagiocephaly is evident with an apparent reduction in the anteroposterior dimension of the anterior cranial fossa.,
This may present as a partial or complete duplication of the eyebrows.,
This midline cranial cleft usually occurs with a midline facial cleft that completes a median craniofacial dysraphia. A broad nasal root and bifid nose are associated with orbital hypertelorism and a median frontal encephalocele. The frontal bone abnormality varies from a minor flattening to a large midline defect. There is an increased distance between the olfactory grooves. The crista galli is widened, duplicated, or in some cases absent. Marked inferior prolapse of the enlarged ethmoid bone occurs with orbital hypertelorism. The severe orbital hypertelorism is associated with a broad flattening of the glabella and extreme lateral displacement of the inner canthi. The periorbita, including the eyelids and eyebrows, are otherwise normal. A long midline projection of the frontal hairline marks the superior extent of the soft tissue features of this midline cranial cleft. The median frontal defect delineates the region through which the frontal encephalocele herniates. The lateral segments of the frontal bone sweep upward from the region of the intact glabella and are flattened laterally. No pneumatization of the frontal sinus is evident. The crista galli and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid are bifid. Just as the ethmoid, including the cribriform plate, is widened and caudally displaced, the sphenoid sinus is broadened and extensively, but symmetrically pneumatized. The lateral rotation of the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid results in a relative shortening of the anteroposterior dimension of the middle cranial fossa. The floor of the anterior cranial fossa is upslanting from its medial aspect to its lateral aspect, with a harlequin appearance on the coronal scan.,
This modifier can be applied to a phenotypic feature that does not vary in severity or amount over time.
This ratio relates the length of the fetal femur to that of the fetal foot. The ratio is approximately 1 throughout the age range of 14 to 40 weeks of gestation. A substantial reduction in the raio can help differentiate fetuses that have dysplastic limb reduction from those whose limbs are short because of constitutional factors or IUGR. It can reduce the problem of an unknown gestational age and help to distinguish between fetal skeletal dysplasia and intrauterine growth retardation caused by other factors.,
This sign is created by a nonenhancing thrombus in the dural sinus surrounded by triangular enhancing dura as seen on cross-section. The sign, seen on contrast-enhanced CT scan images, suggests dural sinovenous thrombosis. It is best seen on wider window settings. It is a reliable sign of sinus thrombosis but is seen only in 25-30% of these cases.,
This sign is seen in pneumomediastinum in which air accumulates between the lower border of the heart and the superior part of the diaphragm, which results in complete visualization of the diaphragm in chest X-ray, hence named continuous diaphragm sign.,
This sign represents thickening and enhancement of the dura mater in continuity with a mass, which on MR images, gives the appearance of a tail arising from the mass. The dural tail is thought to represent reactive change; however, it may also be due to tumor invasion. Three criteria need to be met for a positive dural tail sign

This term applies to all changes in bone mineral density of the tarsal bones, which (depending on severity) can be seen on x-rays as a change in density and or structure of the bone.,
This term applies to all changes in bone mineral density which (depending on severity) can be seen on x-rays as a change in density and or structure of the bone. Changes may affect all bones of the organism, just certain bones or only parts of bones and include decreased mineralisation as may be seen in osteoporosis or increased mineralisation and or ossification as in osteopetrosis, exostoses or any kind of atopic calicfications of different origin and distribution. The overall amount of mineralization of the bone-organ can be measured as the amount of matter per cubic centimeter of bones, usually measured by densitometry of the lumbar spine or hip. The measurements are usually reported as g/cm3 or as a Z-score (the number of standard deviations above or below the mean for the patient's age and sex). Note that measurement with this method does not reflect local changes in other bones, and as such might not be correct with regard the hole bone-organ.,

Tingling (often refered to as a pins and needles feeling) and numbness in the hand.
Tinnitus is an auditory perception that can be described as the experience of sound, in the ear or in the head, in the absence of external acoustic stimulation.
Tiny bumps of thickened skin (hyperkeratosis) on the palms of the hands.
Tiny deposits corresponding to cells floating in the anterior chamber of the eye. This appearance is typically associated with intraocular inflammation leading to breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier and resulting in an increase in the number of cells and in the aqueous humor. Grading (SUN Working Group) is performed by estimating the number of cells in a 1 mm by 1 mm slit beam field, employing adequate light intensity and magnification on a slit lamp.,

Toxic drug response
Toxoplasmosis is a widespread parasitic infection that is frequently asymptomatic in immunocompetent patients. However, this obligate intracellular protozoan parasite can evade the immune system and persist for the life of its host in cyst form, predominantly in the brain, retina, and muscles. Reactivation of latent cysts may occur when the immune system fails to maintain cytokine pressure, which mainly relies on gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). Toxoplasmosis is a life-threatening infection in immunocompromised patients (ICPs).,
Trabecular bladder
Tracheal bleeding
Tracheal calcifications
Tracheal cartilaginous sleeve (TCS) is a rare congenital airway malformation in which distinct tracheal rings are replaced by a continuous cartilaginous segment. Vertically fused C- or O-shaped cartilaginous rings can extend from the subglottis to the carina or bronchus with little to no pars membranacea posteriorly.\nComment
Tracheal disease
Tracheal diverticula are blind-ended outpouchings arising from the trachea. They are usually an incidental finding. Occasionally they can mimic pneumomediastinum. Tracheal diverticula are either congenital or acquired, in the latter case the most common causes are prolonged increased intraluminal pressure, e.g. chronic cough, COPD, tracheomalacia, and iatrogenic (e.g. post-surgical).,

Type III lissencephaly
Type III procollagen synthesis by fibroblasts low
Type V lesions are defined as lesions in which prominent new fibrous connective tissue has formed. When the new tissue is part of a lesion with a lipid core (type IV), this type of morphology may be referred to as fibroatheroma or type Va lesion. A type V lesion in which the lipid core and other parts of the lesion are calcified may be referred to as type Vb. A type V lesion in which a lipid core is absent and lipid in general is minimal may be referred to as type Vc. With these lesions, arteries are variously narrowed, generally more than with type IV. Importantly, as with type IV lesions, type V lesions may develop fissures, hematoma, and/or thrombus (type VI lesion), and for this reason too they are clinically relevant.
Type VI atherosclerotic lesions generally have the underlying morphology of type IV or V lesions, surface disruptions, hematoma, and thrombosis may be (although less often) superimposed on any other type of lesion and even on intima without an apparent lesion. Complicating features may arise because of individual differences in risk factors and tissue reactions. These may include differences in composition of the blood, the relative quantities and distributions in the components of the underlying lesion or intima, as well as modifications of shear and tensile forces to which the lesion or intima is exposed. Clinical imaging of lesions may be expected to contribute greatly to the understanding of type VI lesions and the associated clinical syndromes.,

Vein of Galen aneurysm
Vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation is a choroidal type of arteriovenous malformation that develops between 6 and 11 weeks of gestation. It results from 1 or more arteriovenous fistulas shunting blood toward the prosencephalic vein of Markowski, the embryonic precursor of the vein of Galen. This abnormal shunt leads to progressive dilation of the vein and prevents its involution and subsequent development into the vein of Galen.,

Viral cytopathic changes consist of smudgy basophilic intranuclear inclusions with enlarged nuclei of infected cells. Distal tubules are more commonly involved than proximal tubules. There is associated acute tubular injury, often with frank tubular necrosis and destruction, with acute interstitial nephritis, often with a pleomorphic infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasma cells, and variable numbers of neutrophils, with interstitial edema and hemorrhage. Tubular destruction may be associated with necrotizing interstitial granulomas. Severe granulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis appears to be characteristic of adenoviral infection and is quite rare in other viral infections. Focal wedge-shaped necrosis may occur in renal parenchyma. Immunostaining for adenovirus shows strong nuclear and cytoplasmic staining in infected cells.,

Weakness of the cartilage in the trachea and the bronchi, resulting in a floppy (non-rigid) airway. Affected persons may have difficulties to maintain patency of the airways.,
Weakness of the hip girdle and upper thigh muscles, for instance in myopathies, leads to an instability of the pelvis on standing and walking. If the muscles extending the hip joint are affected, the posture in that joint becomes flexed and lumbar lordosis increases. The patients usually have difficulties standing up from a sitting position. Due to weakness in the gluteus medius muscle, the hip on the side of the swinging leg drops with each step (referred to as Trendelenburg sign). The gait appears waddling. The patients frequently attempt to counteract the dropping of the hip on the swinging side by bending the trunk towards the side which is in the stance phase (in the German language literature this is referred to as Duchenne sign). Similar gait patterns can be caused by orthopedic conditions when the origin and the insertion site of the gluteus medius muscle are closer to each other than normal, for instance due to a posttraumatic elevation of the trochanter or pseudarthrosis of the femoral neck.,
Weakness of the inferior portion of the rectus abdominal muscle, which is ascertained clinically as follows.

White lesions of the oral mucosa are generally caused by a condition that increases the thickness of the epithelium. This increases the distance to the vascular bed and thereby tends to change the usual reddish color of the oral mucosa to white. Common causes include hyperkeratosis (thickening of the keratin layer), acanthosis (thickening of the spinous cell layer), increased edema in the epithelium (leukoedema), and reduced vascularity of the underlying lamina propria. Additionally, fibrin caps or surface ulcerations and collapsed bullae can appear white.

With incomplete partition II, the cochlea consists of 1.5 turns; the apical and middle cochlea turns are undifferentiated and form a cystic apex. The vestibule is normal while the vestibular aqueduct is always enlarged. Developmental arrest occurs at the seventh week of gestation.,
With left or right cardiac isomerism in a biventricular, the atrioventricular connections are perforce ambiguous, in that one of the connections is concordant (e.g., right-sided morphologic right atrium connected to a morphologic right ventricle) and one of the connections is discordant (e.g., left-sided morphologic right atrium connected to a morphologic left ventricle).,
With the eyes in primary position, the sclera is visible above the superior corneal limbus.,
With the hand relaxed and the thumb in the plane of the palm, the axis of the thumb forms an angle of at least 90 degrees with the long axis of the hand.,
With the pathergy test, a small, sterile needle is inserted into the skin of the forearm. The site of injectionis circuled and observed after one and two days. If a small red bump or pustule at the site of needle insertion occurs, the pathergy test is considered to have a positive (abnormal) result.
